    "description": "# Provide Random Number generated by CCV Validator Set  This is the proposal to create the consumer chain \"rand-1\".  RAND chain provide a random number generated by CCV Validator Set. We can use this random number for various dApps that need random number like gacha game, lottery and so on.  RAND chain use ValidatorsHash as a seed for random number. With the CCV state, the provider chain and all consumer chains have same ValidatorsHash. so, we can generate same random number on different consumer chains. This could be useful in multiple consumer chains.  ## How to join  Visit [https://github.com/dsrvlabs/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022/rand ](https://github.com/dsrvlabs/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022/rand) for details on this proposal's data and how to join the chain.",
