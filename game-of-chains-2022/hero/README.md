## Status

* Timeline
  * 2022-11-17: Proposal goes into voting period
  * 2022-11-16: Chain initialized

Hero will launch as a consumer chain through a governance proposal in the `provider` chain. Read the [Consumer Chain Start Process](/docs/Consumer-Chain-Start-Process.md) page for more details about the workflow.

The following items will be included in the proposal:
* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file that the proposer has made available for review.
  * This "fresh" genesis file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV states after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary hash
* Spawn time
  * Even if the proposal passes, the CCV states will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

## Chain Data

### Binary

The binary published in this repo is the `herod` binary built using the `strangelove-ventures/hero` repo tag [v0.0.1](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/hero/releases/tag/v0.0.1). You can generate the binary following the [Get Started section](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/hero/tree/v0.0.1#get-started).

  * [Linux amd64 build](herod)
  * Version: `HEAD-88538019183c85a6a3f3536d0a88fa13b317dc6d`
  * SHA256: `6e2faaa896d8f760d9cb74cab651e3f8988be46b0626e676fc62e904c5d63a71`

### Genesis file

**The genesis file for Interchain Security consumer chains must include the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state generated by the provider chain _after_ the spawn time is reached.**

Final genesis file **with CCV state**: **`pending spawn time`**
- SHA256: `988df79159233ae2707451fcc4d20810b7c2ed16841dcad525ab92b99bfe31b2`
- Validators must replace their `config/genesis.json` file with this one before running the binary.

The genesis file with was generated using the following settings:

* Chain ID: `hero-1`
* Denom: `uhero`
* Signed blocks window: `"8640"`
* Genesis accounts were added to provide funds for a faucet and a relayer that will be run by the testnet coordinators.
* Genesis file **without CCV state**: [`hero-fresh-genesis.json`](hero-fresh-genesis.json), SHA256: `d59c950fc85f53e4407cb27b53cbc89bf168503ae74a603c33dca02c5e73eb93`
  * **This is provided only for verification, this is not the genesis file validators should be running their nodes with.**

## Endpoints

* **p2p persistent peers : `4b5cee15e6a9c4b96b8c1c4f396a18b0461edc17@128.199.29.137:26656,835173badfc41ecbd867a0395c6a452bda2bb90f@128.199.26.103:26656`**
* These peers represent the `goc-coordinator` and `goc-backup` validators (run by the testnet coordinators). 
* The `goc-backup` validator node will be running on Hero shortly after the genesis file that includes the CCV state (Cross Chain Validation state) has been published.
* The `goc-coordinator` validator node has an overwhelming majority of the voting power, and we aim to start it two hours after the spawn time is reached. 67% of the voting power needs to come online for consumer chains to start. Once the `goc-coordinator` is live, the chain will progress.
* Please keep in mind that any validator that does not come online after 67% of the voting power is up and running, is likely to be slashed for downtime, potentially resulting in being jailed (the `signed_blocks_window` parameter is set to `8640`).

## Join via Bash Script

On the node machine:
- Copy the `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` files for your validator.
  - **These should be the same ones as the ones from your provider node**.
- Run one of the following scripts:
  - Hero service: [hero-init.sh](hero-init.sh)
  - Cosmovisor service: [hero-init-cv.sh](hero-init-cv.sh)
- Wait until the spawn time is reached and the genesis file with the CCV states is available.
- Overwrite the genesis file with the one that includes the CCV states.
  - The default location is `$HOME/.hero/config/genesis.json`.
- Enable and start the service:
  - Hero
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable hero
    sudo systemctl start hero
    ```
  - Cosmovisor
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable cv-hero
    sudo systemctl start cv-hero
    ```
- To follow the log, use:
  - Hero: `journalctl -fu hero`
  - Cosmovisor: `journalctl -fu cv-hero`
- If the log does not show up right away, run `systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
