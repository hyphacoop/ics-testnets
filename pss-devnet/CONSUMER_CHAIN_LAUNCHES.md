# Consumer Chain Launch Guide

A consumer chain launch can be divided into the following stages:

* Voting period: The `consumer-addition` addition proposal is in voting period.
* Pre-spawn: The `consumer-addition` addition proposal has passed, but the spawn time has not been reached.
* Spawn: The spawn time has been reached, but blocks have not been produced.
* Start: The chain is producing blocks, but the Cross Chain Validation (CCV) channel has not been established.
* Launched: The chain is producing blocks and the CCV channel has been established: the chain is now interchain-secured.
